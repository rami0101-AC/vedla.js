## FAQ

#### Cool library! I can wait to use it on my super-important production project!

That's not a question. Please try again.

#### (Sigh) Can I use this excellent library in my super important project?

Doctors recommend you don't. My take? Do it if you like to live dangerously. 

Side effects might include:

* Slow website performance.
* Bugs, bugs and sometimes bugs.
* Unexpected behaviour.
* Incompatibility with some web browsers.
* Liking pineapple on pizza.
* Death. 

#### Who is this library for?

It's made for me. I use almost every day some of the functions included in it. But feel free to use it.

#### Which platforms has this been tested on?

As of the time of writing (Feb 2023), the library has been tested on the following:

* Firefox (109.0)
* Chrome (109.0)
* Safari for macOS (16.3)
* Safari for iPadOS and iOS (16.3)

#### Will this work on ____?

Maybe, I am trying to follow modern js standards. Although some browsers like to do things differently (coff coff Apple) so things may brake on some systems.

#### The function/method/variable ____ on line __ in the ___ file is wrong. Are you a **** **** or just dumb?

Wow. what a rude person. I would suggest you have a cookie and come back. You back? Good.
I am a student and have a twinkie's attention span. The code will get better with time. I do love feedback. Please let me know what I did wrong at https://js.velda.io/feedback/

#### Hey, I know you! You are that weird guy in my JS classes at the college. Thanks for helping with my assignments.

Again, not a question. But if you are a classmate, I suggest you don't use this: close your eyes and seek a grown-up assistant. Maybe it can be used as a reference? (But I would say don't) But please write your own stuff. I do not encourage plagiarism. Plus, it feels great to do your own code.


#### My question is not a FAQ. How can I solve my doubts?

Two ways. Reach out to me at https://js.vedla.io/contact or on twitter (If Elon hasn't killed it yet) @itsTayFox.
